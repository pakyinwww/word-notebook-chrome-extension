## Do you collect user data?

**No. This extension does not send or upload any of your data to our servers.**

## Data storage and processing

- **Local storage only**  
  Your saved words and settings (language, lookup service, open in new tab, etc.) are stored only on your device inside your browser (Chrome’s `storage.local` and IndexedDB). They are not sent to the extension developer or any server we operate.

---

## Third-party services

- When you use “Record and lookup” or the lookup action in the list, the **lookup service** you chose (e.g. Perplexity, Google) opens in a new tab and may receive the text you selected as the query. This is triggered by you and is governed by that third party’s privacy policy. This extension does not control or store what that third party receives.

## What we do not do

- We do not collect personal data, run analytics or tracking, execute remote code, or send your word list or settings to our servers.

## Contact

For privacy-related questions, you can contact us via the extension’s GitHub repository or store listing.
